# Sceptre helpers

This repo contains helpers for Sceptre specifically for analysing stack drifts.

## drift_summary.sh

Find all stacks in an AWS account and run drift detection on each. Produce a CSV-formatted summary that can be opened in Excel.

```text
▶ bash drift_summary.sh -h
<%= %x{bash drift_summary.sh -h} -%>
```

## drift_diff.py

Take the output of Sceptre drift detection and present the actual diffs as in unified diff format.

```text
▶ python drift_diff.py -h
<%= %x{python drift_diff.py -h} -%>
```

## drift_report.sh

Given either a stack_name (slow) or a var file, automate detecting drift on that stack and then producing a drift diff.

```text
▶ bash drift_report.sh -h
<%= %x{bash drift_report.sh -h} -%>
```
